π.Lynx.LTE Board Design Files & Datasheet

Description:

π.Lynx.LTE is a 3G/4G/NB-IoT/LTE HAT board which turns your Raspberry Pi or 40-pin Pi compatible single-board-computer into a router or gateway. The board is basically an interface bridge between mini PCIe cellular modems. With the standard mini PCIe modems you insert into HAT, your Raspberry Pi based projects can access data networks all around the world. This board enables high-bandwidth cellular connectivity on your remote devices. From low-power consumption NB-IoT LTE-Cat.M to ultra-high-speed LTE-Advanced mini PCIe cards supported by the board. Both UART and USB communication exist on the board. USB is highly recommended for achieving high-speed download/upload rates.
Remote management of M2M devices in the field, secure connection ( e.g SSH/SSL ) over the mobile network, reliable coverage across the globe with lots of carrier option is available with this HAT stacked on the Raspberry Pi. It can be also used as a standalone LTE modem or dongle with other embedded computer platforms. If you’re looking for an LTE HAT for Raspberry Pi applications like  video streaming or high-speed data transferring, you are at the right place. Making a remote controllable LTE Wi-Fi Hotspot, high-speed GPS tracking, more and more use cases are possible with this add-on board.

Features:

Compatible with Raspberry Pi models and Pi-compatible boards that have the 40-pin GPIO header (4, 3, 2, B+, A+, Zero)
Easy-to-use, simple setup, plug-and-play
QMI, PPP and UART support
Industry standard mini PCIe socket with worldwide LTE, UMTS/HSPA+ and GSM/GPRS/EDGE coverage with regional or global modules which work with different frequencies & carriers.
150Mbps downlink and 50Mbps uplink data rates with Quectel EC25. 
14.4Mbps downlink and 5.76Mbps uplink with Quectel UC20.
SIM socket is easily reachable on top of the board.
Standalone use with PC/Laptop over micro USB, without mounting to RPi header.
LTE HAT can be powered from an external 5V source by a JST connector or directly from Raspberry Pi 5V GPIO headers or also micro USB on the top of the board. 
Efficient power regulator circuit can hold up to  3 A.
Optional Send/Receive AT commands over RPi UART port is available.
Taking the module into the Airplane Mode, resetting module or RI and DTR functions can be accessible over GPIO pins.
The power of the whole board can be turned off using RPi GPIO pin when low-power consumption is required.
Some modules ( e.g EC21 & EC25 & UC20 ) have built-in GNSS ( GPS/GLONASS ) receiver for your location-based applications
